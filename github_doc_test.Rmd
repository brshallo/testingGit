Note that the header options in the .rmd support outputs to both html and md documents -- allowing you to specify which chunks not to render (e.g. not rendering chunks with plotly code that would need to be in html to work properly.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("github_doc_test.Rmd", output_format = "all")

```


# R Markdown

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


val <- knitr::is_html_output()
val

params$output_type
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Other

Test of other

```{r}
plot(mtcars)
```


New change made.

##ggplotly

Note that this plotly does not show-up in the simple .md documents on github as it's rendering javascript here
```{r, plotly version, eval = FALSE}
p <- pressure %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temperature, y = pressure, colour = pressure))+
  geom_point()

plotly::ggplotly(p)
```
