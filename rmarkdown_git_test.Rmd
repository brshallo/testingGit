# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r ggglot}
pressure %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temperature, y = pressure, colour = pressure))+
  geom_point()

```


Note that this plotly does not show-up in the simple .md documents on github as it's rendering javascript here
```{r, plotly version, eval = FALSE}
p <- pressure %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temperature, y = pressure, colour = pressure))+
  geom_point()

plotly::ggplotly(p)
```
